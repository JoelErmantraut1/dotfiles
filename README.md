- There is another windows manager installed, Fluxbox, which is a floating WM.
- The terminal is Alacritty.
- The text editors are Neovim and Sublime-text.
- The main aplicattion launcher is Dmenu. I also use dmenu_extended for some purposes.
- Rofi is installed too. It is useful for change windows, run some aplicattions and for Rofimoji.
- The default web browser is Brave Browser.
- The default file manager is Krusader. It is also configured PCmanFM.
- There are also config files for lots of other apps.
